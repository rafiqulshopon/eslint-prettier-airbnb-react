# Contributing

Hi! 

This repo started as a way to simplify my own development process following [Jeffery Zhen's](https://blog.echobind.com/integrating-prettier-eslint-airbnb-style-guide-in-vscode-47f07b5d7d6a) blog post and it seems others have found it useful too.
I am not in any way proficient in shell scripting, so I am completely open and welcome having others contribute to this project.

If you would like improve this shell script (or any other part of this repo), you can:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new branch and make your local commits with clear messages, limiting a single commit to 1 specific issue.
3. Create a pull request with an explanation.
4. The pull request will be reviewed and merged to the master branch if everything looks good. 

Thanks!
